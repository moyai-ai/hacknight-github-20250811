## Installation Status ‚úÖ
Goose has been successfully installed on your machine at `/Users/roberthommes/.local/bin/goose`
- Version: 1.3.0
- Demo directory created at: `goose-demo/`

## Next Steps You Need to Complete

### 1. Configure Goose with an LLM Provider
You need to configure Goose with an API key from one of the supported providers:

```bash
goose configure
```

#### Recommended Providers:
- **Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (Best performance)
  - Get API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/
  - Model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

- **OpenAI GPT-4o** 
  - Get API key from: https://platform.openai.com/
  - Model: gpt-4o-2024-11-20

- **Google Gemini** (Has free tier)
  - Get API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
  - Model: gemini-2.0-flash-exp

During configuration:
1. Select your provider
2. Enter your API key
3. Choose the recommended model

### 2. Start a Goose Session
After configuration, navigate to the demo directory and start Goose:

```bash
cd goose-demo
goose session
```

### 3. Generate the Tic-Tac-Toe Demo
Once in the Goose session, paste this prompt:
```
create an interactive browser-based tic-tac-toe game in javascript where a player competes against a bot
```

Goose will:
- Create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Implement game logic
- Add AI bot opponent
- Make it browser-ready

### 4. Optional: Enable Computer Controller Extension
For enhanced capabilities (web scraping, automation):
```bash
goose configure
# Select "Computer Controller" extension
# Set timeout to 300 seconds
```

## Testing the System

### Test 1: Verify Installation
```bash
goose --version
# Expected: Should show version 1.3.0
```

### Test 2: Check Configuration
```bash
goose configure
# Should show your configured provider and API key (masked)
```

### Test 3: Run the Generated Game
After Goose creates the tic-tac-toe game:
```bash
# From the goose-demo directory
open index.html  # macOS
# or
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

### Test 4: Web Interface (Alternative)
```bash
goose web --open
```
This opens a web-based interface for Goose.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Goose CLI installed (`which goose` returns path)
- [ ] API key configured (`goose configure` shows provider)
- [ ] Demo directory created (`goose-demo/`)
- [ ] Can start Goose session (`goose session` works)
- [ ] Generated tic-tac-toe game files exist
- [ ] Game runs in browser
- [ ] Can play against AI bot

## Troubleshooting

### If `goose` command not found:
Add to your PATH:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc to make permanent
```

### If API key issues:
- Verify key is active on provider's dashboard
- Check billing/usage limits
- Try a different provider

### If generation fails:
- Ensure you're in the `goose-demo` directory
- Check internet connection
- Verify API quota hasn't been exceeded

## Advanced Usage

### Improve the Game
After initial generation, you can ask Goose to enhance:
- "Add score tracking"
- "Make the AI smarter"
- "Add difficulty levels"
- "Add animations"

### Use GooseHints
Create a `.goosehints` file in your project for context:
```
This is a tic-tac-toe game project.
Use modern ES6+ JavaScript.
Include responsive design.
```
